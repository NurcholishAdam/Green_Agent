# 🌱 Green Agent: A Green Distributed AI Runtime

**Energy-Aware • Carbon-Adaptive • Multi-Agent • Reinforcement-Learned**

A fully distributed, sustainability-first AI agent runtime that integrates energy-aware policy enforcement, hybrid reinforcement learning, distributed multi-agent coordination, real-time Pareto Frontier visualization, carbon-grid adaptive throttling, carbon-credit market simulation, negawatt-based sustainability ranking, and Kubernetes autoscaling.

---

## 🚀 Why This Project Exists

Most AI agent frameworks optimize for:
- **Accuracy**
- **Latency**
- **Throughput**

**This architecture optimizes for:**
- **Accuracy per Watt per Carbon Unit**

We treat energy as a first-class optimization objective, redefining what it means to build intelligent systems in the age of climate awareness.

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy

We extend classical AI benchmarking into four key dimensions:

### 1️⃣ Sustainability Pareto Frontier
Visualizing the trade-off between **Energy (Joules)** and **Accuracy (%)** to identify optimal efficiency points.

### 2️⃣ Negawatt Reward System
Agents are rewarded for **energy saved**, not just accuracy achieved. This inverts traditional optimization objectives.

### 3️⃣ Carbon-Adaptive Intelligence
Agents throttle themselves when the power grid is "dirty," automatically reducing computational intensity during high-carbon periods.

### 4️⃣ Quantum-Inspired Energy Efficiency Metric
```
E_eff = Task Completion Ratio / Σ(Quantum-Inspired Energy Loops)
```
A novel metric that captures energy efficiency across complex, multi-stage agent tasks.

## 🔥 Features Breakdown

### 1️⃣ Ray-Based Distributed Multi-Agent Runtime
- Powered by **Ray**
- Actor-based multi-agent execution
- Autoscaling via Kubernetes
- Fault-tolerant distributed state
- Async task execution

### 2️⃣ PPO + Persistent Q-Table Hybrid Learning
- On-policy PPO fine-tuning
- Persistent Q-table for fast bootstrapping
- Episodic memory across executions
- Policy adaptation based on:
  - Energy usage
  - Accuracy
  - Carbon intensity

### 3️⃣ Negawatt Reward Module
Instead of traditional reward functions:
```
Reward = Accuracy
```

We use:
```
Reward = Accuracy + Energy_Saved_Bonus
```

Agents solving the same task with lower energy consumption get ranked higher on the **Green Leaderboard**.

### 4️⃣ Sustainability Pareto Visualization
Dashboard displays:
- **X-axis:** Energy (Joules)
- **Y-axis:** Accuracy (%)
- Pareto frontier analysis
- Dominated vs non-dominated agents

Built using:
- FastAPI
- Plotly

### 5️⃣ Carbon-Grid Adaptive Throttling
The system queries regional carbon intensity:
- If grid is "dirty" → activate **Eco Mode**
  - Reduce token output
  - Increase pruning
  - Switch to lightweight policies

### 6️⃣ Temporal Carbon Shifting
For non-urgent tasks:
- Suggest delay window
- Show estimated CO₂ savings
- "Delay for Green" option in dashboard

### 7️⃣ Carbon Credit Simulation
Each agent execution:
- Calculates carbon footprint
- Converts CO₂ to simulated carbon credits
- Tracks ESG-style sustainability index

### 8️⃣ Cross-Agent Knowledge Distillation
Agents periodically:
- Share compressed policy representations
- Align value functions
- Improve cluster-wide efficiency

This reduces:
- Redundant exploration
- Energy waste
- Training instability

### 9️⃣ Kubernetes Autoscaling
Ray cluster deployed with:
- Horizontal autoscaler
- Dynamic worker scaling
- Load-aware resource provisioning
